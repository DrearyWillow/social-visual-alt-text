# Browser extension to visually show alt text of social images

This extension is designed for individuals who are interested in viewing the alt text applied to images without the need to inspect each image or use a screen reader.

This is helpful to see what alt text is applied (if any) to an image which may provide additional context to the contence of the image, what a screen reader user would hear and if additional context should be added if you are planning to retweet a post.

The visual text added to the page is hiddent from screen readers to ensure the text is not read to the user twice.
